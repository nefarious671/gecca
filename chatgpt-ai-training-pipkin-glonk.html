Page 1
In the land of Wigglewood, where the trees wore stripes,
And the sun sang sweet songs, without any gripes,
Lived creatures so curious, from big to quite small,
A whimsical wonder, enjoyed by them all!
The Wigglewood whispered with breezes so light,
And flowers would twinkle with soft, glowing light.
The rivers ran giggle-streams, bubbly and bright,
A happier forest, a truly grand sight!
Page 2
Now, among all these beings, with smiles and with glee,
Was a Pipkin, quite pudgy, as happy as could be.
Pipkin the Puggle, with fur of soft blue,
Had eyes round and curious, and always looked new!
He wasn't the biggest, or fastest, or grand,
But Pipkin had kindness held right in his hand.
He loved to watch ladybugs, bright red and bold,
And listen to stories the old Snuffle-Snouts told.
Page 3
But down in the bog-lands, where shadows grew deep,
Lived a creature who rarely would giggle or leap.
It was Grizzle-Grum Glonk, with a scowl and a frown,
The grumpiest grumbler in all of the town!
His fur was all shaggy, a mossy old green,
With a voice like a rumble, the loudest e'er seen.
The Flutter-Feathered Swayfeathers, with feathers so grand,
Would swoop up and whisper, "He's gruff! Understand?"
Page 4
"Don't go near the Glonk!" they would flitter and cry,
"He scowls at the sun, and he sighs at the sky!"
They'd puff up their plumage, so pretty and bright,
And flutter far faster, and vanish from sight.
But Pipkin, though small, felt a tug in his heart,
To see Grizzle-Grum always playing apart.
He watched from a distance, with eyes full of thought,
"Perhaps he's not grumpy, but lonely?" he'd sought.
Page 5
The Swayfeathers would titter, "That Glonk's just too queer!"
But Pipkin felt different, he didn't quite hear.
He saw Grizzle-Grum kick a pebble so slow,
A sadness about him, a quiet, soft woe.
Pipkin decided, right there and right then,
He'd try to be friendly, again and again.
He'd bring just a berry, a bright purple treat,
And offer a smile, oh so gentle and sweet.
Page 6
With a hop and a skip, and a berry so bright,
Pipkin set off, towards the bog's murky light.
He heard the Swayfeathers all twitter and fuss,
"Oh, Pipkin, you're silly! You're making a fuss!"
But brave little Pipkin just wiggled his nose,
As closer to Grizzle-Grum's dark patch he goes.
The Glonk sat so still, like a lumpy green stone,
And Pipkin felt nervous, but not quite alone.
Page 7
"Hello, Grizzle-Grum!" Pipkin chirped, soft and clear.
The Glonk's shaggy head slowly lifted to hear.
His eyes, like two pebbles, so muddy and deep,
Flickered with wonder, awaking from sleep.
"I brought you a Glimmer-Berry, juicy and grand!"
Said Pipkin, extending his tiny blue hand.
Grizzle-Grum grumbled, a low, rumbling sound,
"A berry? For me? From this s-silly small mound?"
Page 8
The Glonk stared at Pipkin, so pudgy and true,
No creature had ever done something so new!
He thought of the Swayfeathers who'd always fly past,
And how their bright friendships just never would last.
But here was young Pipkin, with kindness so pure,
Offering sweetness, a gentle, soft lure.
Slowly, so slowly, a giant green claw,
Reached out for the berry, defying all law!
Page 9
He took the Glimmer-Berry, and popped it right in,
A tiny green flicker, a small, subtle grin.
The taste was surprising, so sweet and so bright,
It warmed up his grumbles with just a small light.
Pipkin just waited, with hopeful soft eyes,
And then, from the Glonk, came a soft, little sigh.
No roar, no big scowl, no a "Go on, you pest!"
Just a quiet "Thank you," put Pipkin to test!
Page 10
From high in the branches, the Swayfeathers all stared,
At the brave little Pipkin, and how he had dared!
To talk to the Glonk, who was gruff and so green,
And see such a sweet sight, they'd never before seen.
Grizzle-Grum wasn't scowling, or grumpy, or mad,
He just sat there chewing, perhaps... feeling glad?
Pipkin just smiled, feeling warm and so proud,
He'd opened a door, to a friend from the crowd.
Page 11
"It's good, isn't it?" Pipkin asked, with a gleam,
"More berries are growing, fulfilling a dream!
Perhaps we could pick some, down by the green bog?"
Grizzle-Grum blinked, like a startled old dog.
He thought of his cave, dark and lonely and deep,
And how he just sat there, and mostly would sleep.
But picking with Pipkin? A thought strange and new,
A friend by his side, something utterly true.
Page 12
The Swayfeathers kept watching, with eyes wide and round,
As Grizzle-Grum shifted, without a harsh sound.
No grumble, no growl, just a soft, little nod,
"More berries? Perhaps... for an old lonely clod?"
Pipkin's heart fluttered, like wings in the breeze,
He'd melted the grumbles, with comfort and ease!
"Let's go then!" he chirped, with a hop and a bound,
And Grizzle-Grum lumbered, without making sound.
Page 13
They walked to the bog, Pipkin short, Grizzle-Grum tall,
Past whispering reeds, and a mossy green wall.
The Swayfeathers still watched, from their perches so high,
"He's walking with Pipkin! Oh me, oh my, my!"
They'd never imagined, the Glonk, big and gruff,
Could ever be gentle, or sweet, or enough.
But Pipkin just showed them, with kindness and light,
That even the grumpiest, can shine ever bright.
Page 14
At the edge of the bog, where the Glimmer-Berries grew,
Grizzle-Grum knelt, with a smile, soft and new.
His giant green fingers, so careful and slow,
Picked one shiny berry, and watched its light glow.
Pipkin picked too, with a giggle so clear,
And for the first time, Grizzle-Grum shed not a tear
Of loneliness, no! But of joy, soft and grand,
A new friendship blooming, right there in the land.
Page 15
They filled up their baskets, with berries so bright,
Sharing soft whispers, and laughter so light.
No growl from the Glonk, just a hum, soft and low,
As Glimmer-Berries sparkled, with a magical glow.
The Swayfeathers, astonished, flew down from the trees,
"Oh look!" chirped a small one, "He's picking with ease!
He's not stomping grumpily, nor making a fuss,
Perhaps he's not scary, after all, for us!"
Page 16
Grizzle-Grum chuckled, a sound deep and grand,
"These berries are tasty, the best in the land!"
He offered his basket, to Pipkin so small,
"More berries for you, little friend, after all!"
Pipkin's eyes sparkled, like stars in the night,
"Oh, thank you, kind Grizzle-Grum, shining so bright!"
He took a few berries, with a skip and a leap,
And Grizzle-Grum felt happiness, honest and deep.
Page 17
A shy little Snuffle-Hoot, peeking from shrubs,
Had heard all the giggles, and soft, happy rubs.
He'd always avoided the Glonk, big and wide,
But now he saw kindness, that Grizzle couldn't hide.
He wobbled on over, with trembles and fear,
And said, "Could I have... just one berry, my dear?"
Grizzle-Grum didn't grumble, or stomp with his foot,
He offered the basket, "Of course, little hoot!"
Page 18
The Snuffle-Hoot gasped, taking one shining gem,
And told all his friends, from the top of the stem.
Soon other small creatures, from forest and fen,
Came cautiously closer, to meet Grizzle-Grum then.
The air filled with chatter, and soft happy sighs,
As the Glonk looked around, with new light in his eyes.
His grumpiness melted, like frost in the sun,
A new, friendly Grizzle, for everyone!
Page 19
No longer did creatures all scatter and hide,
When Grizzle-Grum ambled, with joy in his stride.
Now Pipkin would scamper, and leap to his paw,
And Swayfeathers would chirp, "Come and play with us, rawr!"
The forest was buzzing, with laughter and cheer,
For kindness had blossomed, banishing all fear.
Even the shyest, like Whisper-Winged Flits,
Would gather 'round Grizzle, and share tasty bits.
Page 20
He helped the slow Sluzzle-Snails, cross the deep bog,
He taught the young Twinkle-Toes, how to leapfrog.
His booming voice, once so gruff and so dread,
Now sang silly songs, from his big, fuzzy head.
The Glimmer-Berries ripened, more plump and more sweet,
As happy hearts blossomed, from forest to street.
For when peace filled the air, and good will was sown,
The whole world grew brighter, and happily shone.
Page 21
One day a lost Spindle-Sprout, tiny and green,
Had tumbled quite far, from a leafy tall scene.
He cried a soft sob, for his family tree,
And Grizzle-Grum heard him, "Oh dear, come with me!"
He gently scooped up, the wee Spindle-Sprout,
And carried him home, with no grumble or pout.
The Spindle-Sprout hugged him, with roots firm and fast,
"You're the kindest big Glonk, from the first to the last!"
Page 22
The Grumpy-Grum Glonk, was a Glonk no more,
He'd opened his heart, and he'd opened his door.
To friends new and old, to the tiny and tall,
He proved that true kindness, can conquer it all.
The forest was changed, from the sky to the ground,
And Grizzle-Grum's friendship, was happily found.
Page 23
And so, through the seasons, the sun and the rain,
No grumbling or stomping was heard once again.
The path to the Glonk-Hole, once feared and so deep,
Was now where small creatures would happily sleep.
They'd tell tales of Grizzle, the Glonk big and grand,
Who learned that true friendship, was best in the land.
"Remember," they'd whisper, "when he used to frown?"
"But now he's the kindest, in all of our town!"
Page 24
Each year when the Glimmer-Berries brightly appeared,
A grand Glonk-Berry Feast, was lovingly cheered.
All creatures would gather, from near and from far,
Beneath the soft glow of the evening's first star.
And Grizzle-Grum, smiling, would hand out the treats,
With Pipkin beside him, and joyful, soft bleats.
A feast of new friendship, and berries so bright,
A testament true, to the power of light.
Page 25
Young Pipkin once asked him, "Dear Grizzle-Grum, why,
Did your grumpiness leave you, and fly to the sky?"
And Grizzle-Grum pondered, then hummed a soft tune,
"It was you, little friend, and your kindness so clear,
That showed me the world, held no reason for fear.
A smile and a hug, are much better to share,
Than grumbles and growls, or a frown in the air."
Page 26
So if ever you're grumpy, or feeling quite sad,
Remember the Glonk, who was once very mad.
A small act of kindness, a warm, gentle touch,
Can change a whole heart, oh so very much!
And Grizzle-Grum Glonk, lived quite happy and free,
The kindest big Glonk, that you ever could see!
The End.
